#Project Title: Hero-App

This project is a modern React + Vite application built for fast and interactive web experiences.
It uses a component-based structure and several popular tools to make development efficient and enjoyable.

1.React is used for building the user interface with reusable components.

2.Vite acts as the build tool, providing a fast development server and optimized production builds.

3.React Router manages all the page navigation and data loading within the app.

4.Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI handle the styling and ready-made UI components.

5.Recharts is used to display app rating data through responsive charts.

6.React Toastify shows notifications when users install or uninstall apps.

7.localStorage stores installed apps on the client side so that data remains even after refreshing or closing the tab.
